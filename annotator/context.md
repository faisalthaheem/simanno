# Context for Next Set of Tasks

## Current State

The migration from the Flask backend and AngularJS frontend to Next.js has been completed with the following key achievements:

1. **API Implementation**: All core Flask API endpoints have been migrated to Next.js API routes
2. **Frontend Porting**: The AngularJS annotation interface has been reimplemented in React with enhanced functionality
3. **Database Integration**: SQLite database operations have been implemented in Node.js
4. **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration system has been established
5. **Utility Functions**: Encryption, file management, and other utilities have been ported

## Areas Needing Attention

### 1. Authentication System
The current authentication implementation uses placeholder functions. The real Flask backend uses the `cryptography` library for encryption/decryption, which needs to be properly implemented in Node.js.

**Key Files to Work On:**
- `utils/encryption.js` - Needs proper implementation of Fernet encryption
- `conf/default.creds` - Needs to be properly encrypted
- All API routes that use `authenticateFromHeaders()` - Need to verify against real encrypted credentials

### 2. Database Operations
While basic database operations work, there are several improvements needed:

**Key Files to Work On:**
- `utils/database.js` - Needs transaction support, connection pooling, and better error handling
- Sample database initialization script - Needs to be expanded for full schema

### 3. Image Processing
The current implementation has basic image handling but lacks the full functionality of the Flask backend:

**Key Files to Work On:**
- Image processing functions that were in `imanno.py` - Need to be implemented in Node.js
- ROI (Region of Interest) functionality - Needs to be ported from Flask to Next.js

### 4. Frontend Enhancements
While the React implementation is functional, there are several areas for improvement:

**Key Files to Work On:**
- `pages/index.js` - Could benefit from component decomposition
- Drawing functionality - Could be extracted into reusable components
- State management - Could be improved with context or state management libraries

## Specific Tasks to Continue

### Task 1: Implement Proper Encryption
**Objective**: Replace placeholder encryption functions with proper Fernet encryption implementation
**Files Involved**: 
- `utils/encryption.js`
- All API route files that use authentication

### Task 2: Enhance Database Operations
**Objective**: Add transaction support, connection pooling, and improve error handling
**Files Involved**: 
- `utils/database.js`

### Task 3: Implement ROI Functionality
**Objective**: Port the ROI (Region of Interest) functionality from Flask to Next.js
**Files to Create**: 
- New API routes for ROI operations
- Image processing utilities

### Task 4: Add Comprehensive Testing
**Objective**: Add unit and integration tests for all components
**Files to Create**: 
- Test files for API routes
- Test files for utility functions
- End-to-end tests for frontend functionality

### Task 5: Improve Frontend Architecture
**Objective**: Decompose the large index.js file into smaller, reusable components
**Files to Create**: 
- Separate component files for different parts of the UI
- Context providers for state management

## Important Considerations

1. **Consistency with Original Implementation**: Ensure that the behavior matches the original Flask/AngularJS implementation
2. **Security**: Pay special attention to authentication, input validation, and data protection
3. **Performance**: Consider optimizations for handling large datasets and images
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
5. **Documentation**: Add proper documentation for API endpoints and key functions

## Development Environment Setup

Before starting work on these tasks, ensure you have:
1. Node.js installed
2. SQLite development tools
3. Access to the original project for reference
4. Testing frameworks installed (Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and utilities
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with database operations
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows in the frontend
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

This context should provide a clear understanding of where the project stands and what needs to be done next to complete the migration and enhance the application.
