Simple Image Annotation (SimAnno) Tool for Deep Learning Projects.

SimAnno is a web based image annotation tool that uses sqlite database(s) to maintain annotations for images. At the heart of the project is the great [jquery select areas plugin](https://github.com/360Learning/jquery-select-areas).

SimAnno consists of a front end which is an app written in Angular 8 and is supported by a Flask based python 3 REST service backend.

The tool makes it easy to keep images on a headless environment and access them from any web browser. Once images have been tagged a training record can be generated to be fed to the learning/evaluating scripts. See [life2tfrec.py](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/deep-learning-scripts/blob/master/dbutils/lite2tfrec.py) for an example of how the databases generated by this tool are being used.

The easiest and straightforward way is to use Docker to run the services, see [Running with Docker](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/simanno/wiki/Running-with-Docker) for more information. 

If you would like to run outside of Docker, you will need to install dependencies, please refer to  [Setup Guide](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/simanno/wiki/Setup-Guide) to get started.

# Scripts

There are few useful scripts that faciliate data import and export to/from simanno. The following section describes these briefly.

## app/scripts/import-cat-from-coco.py
Using this script you can extract a category of images from the COCO dataset. For instance, the following command extracts all images belonging to the "cars" category and moves them to a destination folder while also creating a stand alone sqlite db that works with simanno.
```bash
python3 import-cat-from-coco.py \
-t val -c car -li 1 \
-af $COCO_PATH/annotations/instances_val2017.json 
-dp $CARS_FROM_COCO_PATH 
-sp $COCO_PATH/val2017/
```

Where, the parameters are
|Parameter|Valid values|Description|
|---|---|---|
|-t |val or train| Type of dataset that is being created for simanno. Influences the names of db file and destination folder.|
|-c |string| Name of category that should exist in coco dataset.|
|-li|integer| The label index to be assigned when records are added to db. Label text is taken from the -c parameter.|
|-af|path| Path to the coco annotations file.|
|-dp|path| Path to the destination folder which will contain a database file and a folder containing images copied from the coco dataset.|
|-sp|path| Path to the source folder containing coco images to be copied from into the destination folder.|


Alternatively you can use the docker-container version to run this script with the following command
```bash
Todo
```
