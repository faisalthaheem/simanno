Simple Image Annotation (SimAnno) Tool for Deep Learning Projects.

SimAnno is a web based image annotation tool that uses sqlite database(s) to maintain annotations for images. At the heart of the project is the great [jquery select areas plugin](https://github.com/360Learning/jquery-select-areas).

SimAnno consists of a front end which is an app written in Angular 8 and is supported by a Flask based python 3 REST service backend.

The tool makes it easy to keep images on a headless environment and access them from any web browser. Once images have been tagged a training record can be generated to be fed to the learning/evaluating scripts. See [life2tfrec.py](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/deep-learning-scripts/blob/master/dbutils/lite2tfrec.py) for an example of how the databases generated by this tool are being used.

The easiest and straightforward way is to use Docker to run the services, see [Running with Docker](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/simanno/wiki/Running-with-Docker) for more information. 

If you would like to run outside of Docker, you will need to install dependencies, please refer to  [Setup Guide](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/simanno/wiki/Setup-Guide) to get started.
